# major-midwest-aquifers

This map visualizes the "major" aquifers in the Midwest region. 

Data was sourced from the U.S. Geological Survey, found at:
https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/metadata/usgswrd/XML/aquifers_us.xml

I'm also considering overlaying the rivers within the Midwest to visualize surface and groundwater interactions. However, I don't want to make it look too busy.

Also, I'm having an issues with QGIS where when I add a scalebar in layout it won't appear. Any tips on how to fix this/why it's doing that?
